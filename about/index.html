                <h1>About Page</h1>
                
              <p>Hi!  My name is Parker Birr if you didn't catch that already. :P  If you're here at the about page then you have probably already               seen my other two pages. The reason this website exists was initially for a composition class in my freshman year of college at                   Michigan Technological University.  But since I was planning to make a website anyway, I figured I may as well have stuff about                   myself too!</p>
              <p>I have lived most of my life in Manistique, Michigan which is pretty much right at the top of Lake Michigan in Michigan's Upper                 Peninsula (U.P.).  I am currently attending Michigan Tech in Houghton all the way up in the Keweenaw Peninsula.  I am studying                     Chemical Engineering and enjoying all the snow and other beautiful weather we get up here!  I game a fair amount now too (almost a                 requirement if you go to Tech :P) through a gaming platform called Steam.  *psssst it's the icon on the right at the bottom of the                 page!*  I play a lot of Team Fortress 2 (tf2) and I like to play co-op games with my friends like Left 4 Dead 2 and Awesomenauts.                 And seeing as I have my own website and everything you'd probably assume I am a huge techy guy, but that is far from the truth!  I                 actually only got into this stuff since I came to Tech and I still am quite far from a computer master.  It's just fun to tinker                   with this stuff.  And I have to give all of the credit to becoming so interested and excited about all of this to my friend Paul.  He               lives right next door to me and he helped with all of the questions I had when it came to building this site.</p>
              <p>So right about now I figured I'd share some pictures with you because why not?
              This is my brother and sister and then my brother with one of his friends being goofy in the gym. :P

              So I also have a gorgeous girlfriend and she has this cute cat as well and I can't help but share them both.

              Oh yeah!  I also live on a farm, somewhat.  We have horses and chickens and stuff and lots of space and it's pretty nice.  So here's               a pic of my horses and chickens. :P</p>
              <img src="" alt="">
              <p>Last summer (2014) I went on a trip out west with my brother and sister and her husband.  My favorite place was Glacier National                   Park in Montana.  It was gorgeous and this picture can't even come close to the beauty of this place but I'll try and give you at                 least an idea and definitely encourage you to check stuff like this out in your lifetime.

                Oh!  And I must leave you with this awesome article of clothing before you go!  This is called the "Cat Hero" sweatshirt and I got                 it at Beloved.com and it is glorious.  Props to Paully and his internet abilities to be able to find this wonderful thing.</p>
                <img src="/img/about-11.png" alt="">
              <p>So yeah!  That's about it for me.  Thanks for checking out my site! &lt;3  I'll leave you with more pictures of my cats. :D</p>
